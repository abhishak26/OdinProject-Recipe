<p>Fried rice is a savory dish made by stir-frying cooked rice with vegetables, protein (like chicken, shrimp, or tofu), and flavorful seasonings such as soy sauce and garlic. Often prepared with day-old rice, it’s quick, versatile, and easily customizable to suit any taste. The result is a satisfying, flavorful dish that can be enjoyed on its own or as a side to other meals.</p>
<h1>Ingredients:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups cooked rice (preferably day-old for better texture)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or any cooking oil)</li>
    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>1 medium carrot, diced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup frozen peas (or any veggies of your choice)</li>
    <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten (optional, for extra richness)</li>
    <li>1 cup cooked protein (such as chicken, shrimp, tofu, or pork, chopped)</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce (adjust to taste)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil (optional, for added flavor)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
    <li>2 green onions, chopped (for garnish)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps to Cook:</h1>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the rice:</strong> Use day-old rice for the best texture. If using fresh rice, let it cool down to reduce moisture.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the eggs (optional):</strong> In a large skillet or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat.
        Pour in the beaten eggs, scramble them, and cook until fully set. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
    <li><strong>Sauté the vegetables:</strong> Add another tablespoon of oil to the same pan. Add chopped onions and garlic, and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
        Add the diced carrots and peas (or other vegetables), and cook for another 3-4 minutes until tender.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the protein:</strong> Add your cooked protein (chicken, shrimp, tofu, etc.) and stir-fry for a couple of minutes to heat through.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir-fry the rice:</strong> Add the day-old rice to the pan and break up any clumps. Stir-fry for 4-5 minutes until the rice is heated through and slightly crispy.</li>
    <li><strong>Season the rice:</strong> Add the soy sauce, sesame oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir well to evenly coat the rice with the sauces.</li>
    <li><strong>Add eggs and garnish:</strong> Return the cooked eggs to the pan, breaking them into pieces. Stir everything together.
        Garnish with chopped green onions and serve immediately.</li>
